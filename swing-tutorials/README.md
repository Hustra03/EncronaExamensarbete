This folder contains the files created following Oracles "Trail: Creating a GUI With Swing".  

The folder oracleExamples contains GUI examples for Swing created by Oracle, with these being unchanged from the version available online.
The folder testing contains tests made, using the above examples as a source of inspiration, with minimual modification to test ideas, so the copyright notice will be kept (the real GUI will be created from scratch with both of these as an examples, so will not include it).
